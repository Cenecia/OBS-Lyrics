# OBS-Lyrics
Manage and display lyrics to any text source in your OBS scene. 

## How to use
1. Download the script and open it with OBS.
2. Add some songs to the script and save them.
3. Select the text source for displaying the lyrics. Set the amount of lines to display, default is 2. Optionally, you can setup hotkeys to control the lyrics display. 
4. Select a song from the song directory and click "Prepare Song". Do that to as many songs as you will need for the session.
5. Once you are ready to display the lyrics, select the song you'd like to display from the "Prepared Songs" list and click "Show/Hide Lyrics" button or the appropriate hotkey.
6. Advance lyrics as needed using the buttons or appropriate hotkeys. You can also advance to the next prepared song using hotkeys.
7. When you're finished with the current song, hide the lyrics and select the next song from the "Prepared Songs" list. 

There is a much more in-depth guide [here](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/display-lyrics-as-subtitles.1005/).

## Things to know
- Append `###` to the end of a line to display it by itself.
- Use `//` to write a comment that will not display to your viewers, e.g. `We sing to you God //repeats 5 times`
- Continue clicking `Advance lyrics` after the end of a song to begin the next prepared song.

## That's it
