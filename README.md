# OBS-Lyrics
Manage and display lyrics to any text source in your OBS scene. 

## How to use
1. Download the script and open it with OBS.
2. Add some songs to the script and save them.
3. Select the text source for displaying the lyrics. Set the amount of lines to display, default is 2. Optionally, you can setup hotkeys to control the lyrics display. 
4. Select a song from the song directory and click "Prepare Song". Do that to as many songs as you will need for the session.
5. Once you are ready to display the lyrics, select the song you'd like to display from the "Prepared Songs" list and click "Show/Hide Lyrics" button or the appropriate hotkey.
6. Advance lyrics as needed using the buttons or appropriate hotkeys. 
7. When you're finished with the current song, hide the lyrics and select the next song from the "Prepared Songs" list. 

Please post any bugs or feature requests here to the OBS forum. 

Feel free to make pull requests for any features you implement yourself, I'll be happy to take a look at them.
